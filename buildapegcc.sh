# Joshua's ape gcc build script 0.10.0
# Based on https://github.com/ahgamut/musl-cross-make/blob/cibuild/.github/workflows/release.yml
# Changes
#.0.10.0: Update cosmo to a commit from 2023/09/07, there are currently some major
#         issues with windows support including random crashing so not going any
#         further for now.
#         Remove git disable patch since it is no longer needed.
#0.9.0: Use the current newest version of cosmo from 2023/08/27 ðŸŽ‰
#       I think a few extra warnings appeared but it does build and work correctly
#0.8.0: Use a slightly newer version of cosmo from 2023/08/16, update getopt patch
#0.7.0: Use a slightly newer version of cosmo, cleanup script slightly and remove now
#       unneeded correction to cosmocc
#0.6.1: Modify cosmocc so that --update works in this environment
#0.6.0: Again use a slightly newer version of cosmo, this time from 2023/08/14
#       Needed to replace setup-cosmos script since it no longer exists
#0.5.0: Again use a slightly newer version of cosmo, this time from 2023/08/13
#       Remove chmod on cosmopolitan.a as it is no longer required
#0.4.0: Updated to a slightly newer version of cosmo with an updated cosmocc
#       Add fix for cosmocc checking for execute permission on cosmopolitan.a
#0.3.0: Use a newer version of cosmo from 2023/08/12 instead of one from 2023/07/25
#       Cleanup cosmo download code slightly by not using a subshell
#0.2.1: Using same cosmo commit but now from the main repo, manually add getopt change
#0.2.0: Reverted to an old version of cosmo that has been tested for building gcc
#       will move back to a newer version once I get that working properly
